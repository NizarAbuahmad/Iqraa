_Last verified: 2026-08-10, against the running system (local Linux checkout +
the hosted demo API). Earlier lines carried over from the 2026-08-06 pass on
Windows 11 are marked where they were not re-checked._

## What Iqraa is

Arabic-native AI teaching assistant for the Jordanian national curriculum
(Grade 10 math + chemistry first). Teachers get a full lesson journey —
objectives → warmup → activity → practice → worksheet → exit ticket — not just
generated text. Differentiators: curriculum-anchored content, SymPy-verified
math answer keys (`artifacts/math-verifier`), RTL/Arabic-first UX.

## Strategy (decided 2026-08-06)

Investor demo with **real, visible math verification**; all prose/content
generation stays mocked (`DEMO_MODE = true` in
`artifacts/mobile/services/ai/demoMode.ts` — do not flip it without a decision).
Vision screens (student/parent/school dashboards) are deprioritized.

> **The strategy is currently not met.** The SymPy verifier has never been
> deployed (see "Hosted demo" below), so nothing in the hosted demo is
> symbolically verified. The code works; the service is missing.

## What works today (verified, not assumed)

- `pnpm install` and full `pnpm run typecheck` pass clean (checked on Windows
  2026-08-06 and on Linux 2026-08-10).
- Mobile test suite: 287 tests, 0 failures (10 skipped). The `test` script
  globs `services/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` — it used to be a hand-listed set of
  files that had drifted, so two suites never ran.
- API test suite: 31 tests, 0 failures. Its `test` script globs
  `src/**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts`; it was scoped to `src/modules/**` and so
  never ran anything under `src/lib` or `src/routes`. The mount-order suite
  boots the built bundle, so run `pnpm build` before `pnpm test` or it skips.
- Local dev runs end to end: Express API (:8080) + Postgres 17 (`iqraa` db,
  6 tables) + Expo web (:8083). Login/register work against the local DB.
- Curriculum data loads in-app (math S1: 4 units / 18 lessons). It now lives in
  `lib/curriculum` (`@workspace/curriculum`), shared by mobile and the API —
  `services/curriculumData.ts` and `services/curriculumG10*.ts` are re-export
  shims, so app imports are unchanged. The API serves it at `/api/curriculum/*`
  (grades, subjects, books, units, lessons, objectives) because evaluation
  questions must be generated and graded against objectives server-side.
- **Math S1 is fully objective-backed.** Units 2–4 were title-only (13 lessons,
  zero objectives) because only the student book was on hand, which states
  objectives per unit. They were completed from the Semester 1 teacher guide's
  `مخطَّط الوحدة` tables (book pages 36B / 76B / 110B): per-lesson objectives,
  vocabulary and period counts. Math S1 went from 11 objectives to 59, and every
  Sem1 lesson now carries at least one (guarded by test).
  - Extraction needs the **winget poppler build**, not `/mingw64/bin/pdftotext` —
    the latter returns almost no Arabic from these NCCD PDFs, which is why the
    guide looked unusable. Even with the right build the text layer mangles the
    lam-alef ligature (`المعادلات` → `المعادالت`) and drops some hamza carriers,
    so the tables were transcribed from `pdftoppm` renders instead.
  - **Edition mismatch, unresolved:** the teacher guide gives Unit 2 a fifth
    lesson (الدوائر المتماسة, 3 حصص) plus a توسُّع item that the student book on
    file does not have. Not added — see `known_gaps` in the curriculum JSON.
- Objective counts, NCCD data in `lib/curriculum/src/data/*.json`: math S1 59,
  math S2 61, financial literacy 40, chemistry S1 12 (across 3 units /
  9 lessons, and 3 of those lessons still have none).
  - Separately, `lib/curriculum/src/catalog.ts` holds a small hand-authored
    catalog with real Bloom's levels — 4 of its objectives are chemistry S1.
    **These are two different datasets; do not read "chemistry 4" as the
    chemistry objective count.** Everything not hand-authored is stamped
    `'Understand'` by the catalog builders, so objectives expose
    `bloomsSource: 'authored' | 'defaulted'` and an `inferredBloomsLevel`
    derived from the Arabic action verb.
    See `docs/student-evaluation-module-plan.md`.
- Chemistry is thinner than "math + chemistry first" implies: 3 units /
  9 lessons against math's 4 / 18 per semester.
- Financial Literacy G10 S1 is browsable (2 units / 10 lessons, NCCD-sourced).
  It was previously offered as a subject tile with no book behind it, so the
  subject dead-ended on the "no semesters" empty state.
- Expo Go on a phone works over LAN (firewall rule `Iqraa-Dev-8080-8083`;
  see LOCAL_SETUP.md).
- `mockup-sandbox` is excluded from the workspace — it is a design sandbox,
  not product UI, and its type errors used to block the whole monorepo build.
- **Hosted demo is partly live** (2026-08-07, free tier — see render.yaml).
  `render.yaml` declares **three** services. Two are up, the third never was:
  - Web: https://iqraa-web.onrender.com (static, always awake) — **up**
  - API: https://iqraa-api-dfxu.onrender.com (`iqraa-api` name was taken —
    note the `-dfxu` suffix; sleeps after ~15 min idle, ~30-60s to wake.
    **Warm it up before demos.**) — **up**, login verified 2026-08-10
  - Verifier: `iqraa-verifier` (SymPy/FastAPI, `artifacts/math-verifier`)
    — **NOT DEPLOYED.** `POST /api/verify/derivative` on the hosted API returns
    `client_error:fetch failed`, i.e. the connection is refused rather than
    timing out. Consistent with `MATH_VERIFIER_URL` being unset, which makes
    `mathVerifierClient` fall back to `http://127.0.0.1:8090` — localhost
    inside the API container, where nothing listens.
    To check at any time, unauthenticated:
    `GET /api/healthz/verifier` → `{"verifier":"ok"|"unreachable"}`.
    To fix: apply the Render blueprint so `fromService` wires
    `MATH_VERIFIER_URL`, or create the service by hand and set that env var on
    `iqraa-api` yourself, then restart the API.
  - DB: Neon free Postgres, project "iqraa", eu-central-1 (Frankfurt).
    Schema pushed; register/login verified end-to-end against it.
  - Demo account: demo@iqraa.app / IqraaDemo2026
  - Note the verifier is free-tier too, so it will sleep after ~15 min once
    deployed. The client's timeout is 2.5s, so the first call after idle fails.
    **Warm the verifier as well as the API before a demo** — a sleeping
    verifier and an undeployed one look the same from the app.

## Teacher UX pass — merged 2026-08-10

Was on `feat/evaluation-authoring`; **now merged into `main`** (`06ed814`).
Nothing is outstanding on that branch. The only unmerged work in the repo is
two parked chat-redesign branches — see "Open decisions".

General rule that still applies: the deployed site only shows what is on
`main`, which is the usual reason a change "did not appear" — check
`git log origin/main..origin/<branch>` before debugging anything visual.

Landed, in order:

- **Arabic typeface.** The app shipped with no Arabic font: all 574 `fontFamily`
  declarations asked for Inter, which has no Arabic glyphs, so every Arabic
  string was drawn by a per-device fallback at that fallback's own weight —
  bold headings were not reliably bold. Almarai now carries body, Cairo carries
  500/600/700. Chosen to map 1:1 onto the four Inter weights already in use.
- **Iqraa's mark.** `BrandLogo` is a 1024px two-line lockup and was being drawn
  at 22px in avatars, where it greys into a smudge — the "empty circles". New
  `IqraaMark` draws the leaf as vector for small sizes; BrandLogo stays where
  there is room for it.
- **Student mode removed** from the Iqraa screen. `Mode` narrowed to a single
  member so the compiler finds anything that still branches.
- **Grounding is stated.** All four tools now say whether output is anchored to
  a curriculum lesson, and name it when it is. Matters most because maths draws
  on a curated bank of 87 real problems while chemistry and financial literacy
  fall through to templates, and nothing showed the difference.
- **Document upload paused** behind `DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_ENABLED` in
  `services/features.ts`. Off because the curriculum already ships in the app,
  so uploading a textbook page pays to send content we hold — and with real
  generation on, it rides along as tokens on every request. Everything behind
  the flag still compiles; flip to `true` to restore.
- **Inline editing.** Generated material is editable in place (no edit mode) on
  the lesson-plan screen, the quiz screen, and lesson plans in chat.
  `LessonPlanView` is shared between the tool screen and chat so the two cannot
  drift. Quiz edit transforms live in `services/quizEdits.ts` with tests: the
  trap is that `correctAnswer` stores option **text**, so rewriting the correct
  option without carrying the key leaves a question with no right answer.
- **Chat stopped discarding structure.** It calls the same generators as the
  tools, then used to flatten the result to a string one line later.
  `ChatArtifactResult.data` now keeps the object; worksheet/quiz/activity carry
  it but still render as text until each gets a view.

## Open decisions (2026-08-10)

- **Home vs chat.** They duplicate each other: both carry the current lesson,
  the tool chips, and a text box. Home's box is a keyword router dressed as an
  assistant — `inferToolFromPrompt` matches on واجب/ورقة/اختبار/نشاط/خطة and
  silently defaults to lesson-plan for anything else, and `extractLessonTopic`
  strips a verb and passes the rest as a topic string. Proposal on the table:
  make chat the landing tab and fold home's useful parts (current lesson, what
  is ready, «تابع العمل») into its opening state; retire the home tab. Nizar's
  own Stitch mockup kept them separate, so the reason for the split is worth
  settling before acting.
  - Two branches are parked on this decision, one commit each, both unmerged
    and both redesigning the same surface: `claude/ikra-chat-ux-i087se` and
    `claude/ikra-chat-agent-uiux-1j6wpm`. Deciding the tab question decides
    whether to land, rebase, or delete them. They are the only unmerged work
    in the repo.
- **Which model backs AI grading** (blocks the evaluation module's AI-grading
  phase only — see docs/student-evaluation-module-plan.md §8).
- **Math S1 Unit 2 edition mismatch**: the teacher guide lists a fifth lesson
  (الدوائر المتماسة) the student book on file does not have. Recorded in the
  curriculum JSON's `known_gaps`, not merged in.

## Top blockers (in priority order)

1. **Verifier not deployed.** Nothing in the hosted demo is symbolically
   verified, and the demo strategy is built on it being verified. One Render
   service away. Details in "Hosted demo" above. The code itself is fine —
   `python prove_slice.py` passes 20/20 with zero wrong keys.
2. **No external validation.** Zero real teachers have used the product.
   Getting 3–5 Jordanian teachers on it beats any further polish.
3. **Verifier not visible in UI.** The app doesn't surface verification
   (badge / rejected-count / proof panel). The API now returns
   `verificationSource: 'sympy' | 'code_template'` alongside `verified`, so
   there is something truthful to render — a badge must read from both, or it
   will claim verification on template items again.
4. **OpenAPI drift.** Generated clients reference routes the API doesn't
   implement; real `/auth/*`, `/workspace/*` routes missing from the spec.
   *(Carried from 2026-08-06, not re-verified. The `/auth/*` and `/workspace/*`
   routes do exist in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/`; the spec side was not
   re-checked.)*
5. **i18n debt.** ~2,000 hardcoded strings vs ~500 i18n keys. *(Carried from
   2026-08-06, counts not re-verified.)*

## Known landmines

- `gpt-5.6-luna` model id is hardcoded in three api-server files
  (`derivativeVerified.ts`, `routes/generate.ts`, `routes/chat.ts`) — likely
  invalid; irrelevant while DEMO_MODE is on, blocking the day it's turned off.
- `DEMO_MODE` mocks AI but **not** auth: any demo needs a live API + Postgres.
- `chat.ts` and `generate.ts` construct the OpenAI client at module scope, so
  the API will not boot without `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to *something*, even
  though DEMO_MODE means no model is called. Render passes a placeholder for
  exactly this reason. `derivativeVerified.ts` was changed to import it lazily;
  the other two were left alone.
- Curriculum PDFs tracked in git (8 files, one on LFS; `.git` is ~67MB) —
  slow clones.
- Legacy duplicate `lib/integrations/openai_ai_integrations` mirrors the active
  `lib/integrations-openai-ai-server`.
- `app/ai-tools/classroom/classroomRouting.ts` is a helper inside the routes
  dir — Expo Router registers it as a phantom route and warns on every boot.

## Fixed 2026-08-10 — worth knowing about

Both were silent: the system reported success while doing nothing.

- **Verification was claimed, not performed.** `generateTemplateItem` treated an
  unreachable verifier as grounds to return `verified: true`, trusting the
  power rule it had just computed in code. So from 2026-08-07 the hosted API
  served a stream of items flagged verified that nothing had checked, and an
  unreachable verifier was indistinguishable from a passing one. `verified` now
  means *the verifier confirmed this*, and a new `verificationSource`
  (`'sympy' | 'code_template'`) carries how the key was established. Items are
  still served when the verifier is down — the key is computed, not guessed —
  they just no longer claim to be verified. The batch route's `pass` now
  requires that everything was actually checked. Guarded by tests in
  `src/lib/__tests__/derivativeVerified.test.ts`.
  - The AI path was already correct: it fails closed and returns nothing rather
    than an unverified item. Only the template path failed open.
- **Root-mounted auth swallowed later routers.** `roster.ts` and
  `evaluations.ts` are mounted at the root of `/api` and both called a bare
  `router.use(authMiddleware)`, which in Express matches every path — so every
  request reaching them was answered 401 before `chat`, `generate` and
  `verifiedMath` were consulted. Those three were guarded by accident of mount
  order, never by intent, and any reordering would have silently made two
  OpenAI-backed routes public. All guards are now path-scoped. The tell was
  that an unowned path like `/api/no-such-route` returned 401 instead of 404;
  `src/routes/__tests__/mountOrder.test.ts` asserts exactly that, and caught
  the fix reintroducing the bug in a different form.
- New `GET /api/healthz/verifier` — public, cheap, reports whether the verifier
  is reachable. Deliberately not folded into `/api/healthz`, which is Render's
  health check path: a sleeping verifier must not be able to take the API down
  with it.

## Working agreement

- One checkout: `Code\Iqraa` (the old `Downloads\Iqraa\Iqraa` copy is retired —
  everything unique from it was merged via PR #1).
- All changes via feature branches + PRs; `main` is merge-only.
- Verify claims against the running system before acting on any doc, including
  this one. Two of today's findings were things this file asserted or implied
  and the running system contradicted.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root points agent sessions here and carries the
  commands plus the traps that have bitten before. It is deliberately short —
  **state belongs in this file, not there.** `.agents/memory/` holds four deeper
  context files (`MEMORY.md`, `iqra-architecture.md`, `ai-integration.md`,
  `auth-workspace-api.md`).
- `docs/demo-checklist.md` is the pre-demo runbook: warm the API *and* the
  verifier, confirm the verifier is real via `GET /api/healthz/verifier`, and
  prove it is checking with a wrong-answer control.
